title: Game Off 2018! (Using PICO-8)
date: 2018-10-27
---

Next month marks GitHub's fifth annual [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018), where participants spend one
month creating games based on a theme that GitHub provides once the contest begins. This will be my first game jam
and it sounds like an interesting opportunity to learn something new.

For this project I'm going to be checking out [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), one of a few available
'fantasy consoles' used for making small games and other computer programs which uses a subset of the Lua programming
language. I've been spending the past couple days getting up to speed with the PICO-8 and am excited to see what
comes of it.

*"PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs."*

I'll be writing some follow up posts tracking my progress throughout the month - can't wait to see what this year's
there is going to be.
