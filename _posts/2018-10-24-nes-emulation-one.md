title: A Journey in NES Emulation

NES emulation has been done again and again for decades, yet seemly every year there is a new take on this monumental task using new languages, frameworks, and technologies. So what makes this iteration special?

Frankly, nothing - but that's not really the point. Contemporary NES emulation is exciting to developers because it's a project that blends the syntax and feature-richness of modern programming languages with the exercise of taking a deep dive into the inner workings of the 6502/2A03 microprocessor and other NES internals. 

On the other side you end up with a deep knowledge of one of the most iconic entertainment systems in existance while flexing your desired language of choice; it's a win-win, at the expense of several hours dedicated to poring over documentation and source-code of others who have braved the journey before you.

This is a multi-part series I plan on writing to document my journey in creating yet another NES emulator using the Kotlin programming language. Stay tuned - more to come.
